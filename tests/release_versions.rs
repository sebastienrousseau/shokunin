//! Release version-coherence gate.
//!
//! Every publishable crate in the workspace must carry the same
//! version as the root `ssg` crate, and every internal dependency
//! pin must name that same version.
//!
//! ## What this catches
//!
//! Version drift between the root crate and the workspace members it
//! depends on. `release.yml` publishes `ssg-core`, `ssg-rpc-macro`,
//! `ssg-rpc`, `ssg-search` and `ssg-a11y` to crates.io before `ssg`
//! itself, because crates.io verifies path dependencies against the
//! registry. If a member's version was not bumped along with the
//! root, the first `cargo publish` of the release aborts with
//! `error: crate <name>@<version> already exists on crates.io index`
//! and nothing downstream of it publishes.
//!
//! That is not hypothetical. Between v0.0.47 and v0.0.50 the members
//! stayed pinned at `0.0.47` while the root advanced to `0.0.50`, so
//! the v0.0.48 release failed at the very first publish, `ssg` was
//! skipped, and crates.io fell two versions behind the README's own
//! install instruction.
//!
//! The failure surfaced only after a tag had been pushed — the point
//! at which it is most expensive, because a tag that produced no
//! release has to be deleted and re-cut. This test moves the same
//! signal to every `cargo test` run.
//!
//! ## Methodology
//!
//! Parse the root and member manifests directly. No TOML crate: the
//! fields involved are single-line `key = "value"` entries, and
//! `tests/docs_accuracy.rs` sets the precedent for keeping this kind
//! of gate dependency-free.
