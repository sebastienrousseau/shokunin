//! Hard performance budgets — these tests fail CI when wall-clock
//! exceeds the documented threshold.
//!
//! Where `tests/perf_regression.rs` checks fine-grained per-operation
//! sub-millisecond budgets (slugify, URL parsing, frontmatter walk),
//! this suite checks **end-to-end build budgets** at realistic page
//! counts, against the same `compile_site` entry point a user
//! invokes via `cargo run`.
//!
//! ## Budget table (resolves issue #471 P0 + analysis batch E)
//!
//! | Pages | Local M-arm64 baseline | CI budget (this gate) |
//! |-------|------------------------|------------------------|
//! |   10  | < 5 ms                | **< 100 ms**           |
//! |  100  | 18.7 ms (full build)  | **< 500 ms**           |
//! |  500  | extrapolated < 100 ms | **< 2,000 ms**         |
//!
//! The CI budgets are deliberately ~10× the local baseline to absorb
//! GitHub Actions runner variance (cold-cache compile, shared CPU,
//! macOS/Windows runners ~3× slower than Linux). They are *ceilings*
//! — any genuine algorithmic regression will blow well past the
//! ceiling. The aggressive sub-50ms target tracked in #471 lives in
//! `tests/perf_regression.rs` once the bench corpus template is
//! fixed.
//!
//! ## Skip behaviour
//!
//! These tests run a real `compile_site`, which requires the
//! example template directory. If it's missing (rare, only on
//! corrupted checkouts), the tests skip with an explanatory
//! message rather than failing.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Every test creates a fresh `TempDir`, generates a deterministic
//! corpus (`generate_corpus` mirrors the bench harness in
//! `benches/bench_scalability.rs`), runs one warmup iteration to prime
//! caches, then takes the **fastest** of five measured runs. The
//! minimum rather than a median, because runner interference is
//! one-sided — see `best_of`.
//!
//! ## Two kinds of gate
//!
//! The absolute ceilings in the table above are enforced on Linux only,
//! where they were calibrated. A wall-clock ceiling measures the machine
//! as much as the code, and on the shared Windows runner the same
//! 10-page build produced 131.00 ms and then 323.61 ms on consecutive
//! runs.
//!
//! The gate that runs everywhere is
//! `build_cost_per_page_does_not_grow_with_corpus_size`, which compares
//! per-page cost at two large corpus sizes. Both measurements happen on
//! the same machine moments apart, so machine speed divides out and what
//! remains is whether compilation still scales linearly — the regression
//! class actually worth gating.
