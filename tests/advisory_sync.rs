//! Keeps the two advisory ignore lists consistent.
//!
//! `deny.toml` drives `cargo-deny`; `osv-scanner.toml` drives the
//! `OSV-based` checks `OpenSSF` Scorecard runs. They answer the same
//! question about the same project and are maintained by hand, which is
//! how they drifted: `osv-scanner.toml` carried five advisory IDs that
//! `deny.toml` did not, and lacked one that it did, while its own header
//! claimed the two matched "exactly". Nothing checked, so nothing
//! noticed.
//!
//! The invariant asserted here is a superset, not equality, because the
//! two tools resolve different graphs. `cargo-deny` walks the
//! feature-resolved tree; `OSV` scans the lockfile, which lists optional
//! dependencies whether or not a feature enables them. So `OSV` can
//! legitimately need to ignore something cargo-deny never sees —
//! RUSTSEC-2026-0235 is exactly that — but the reverse is always a
//! mistake: an advisory deliberately accepted for cargo-deny and absent
//! here means Scorecard reports a vulnerability the project has already
//! reasoned about.
